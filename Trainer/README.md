# **Directory Structure Information**

This is the complete directory structure required to open and build the project in **Visual Studio** (not Visual Studio Code).
 
**All of the trainer logic and main code for this project is contained in [`Form1.cs`](Form1.cs).**
The other files and folders are standard files automatically generated by Visual Studio for building and running the project.

> **Tip for Beginners:**  
> If you're just starting out with C# or Visual Studio, you can safely ignore most of these files and focus on **Form1.cs**â€”that's where all the main logic of the trainer is written.  
> The rest are standard files needed to make the project build and run smoothly in Visual Studio.
