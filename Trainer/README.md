# **Directory Structure Information**

This is the complete directory structure required to open and build the project in **Visual Studio** (not Visual Studio Code).
 
**All of the trainer logic and main code for this project is contained in [`Form1.cs`](Form1.cs).**
The other files and folders are standard files automatically generated by Visual Studio for building and running the project.
